The [hCNV tools list](https://github.com/users/khaled196/projects/1) was created as a reference for the tools that use WES datasets as input. 

The list is a GitHub project table, and it contains most of the information about the hCNVs tools, including the tool name, source, CONDA source and galaxy source (if applicable)
